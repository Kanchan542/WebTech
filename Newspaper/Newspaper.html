                        The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday the country is likely to witness a warmer start to the summer season this year. IMD Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said at a press conference that India is likely to see above-normal maximum and minimum temperatures in most parts of the country during the "Hot Weather Season 2024" between March and May."During the upcoming hot weather season (March to May (MAM)), above-normal maximum temperatures are most likely over most parts of the country, except over some isolated areas of Northwest, Northeast, Central and Peninsular India where normal to below-normal maximum temperatures are most likely," a press release by the IMD read.The weather department said monthly maximum temperatures for March 2024 are most likely to be above normal over most areas of Peninsula, Northeast and West Central India and many areas of North West India."On the other hand, normal to below normal maximum temperatures are most likely over most parts of East and East-Central India and some parts of Northwest India," the press release added.

                    Arshad Khan punished on the first delivery as Shaw drives it down straight for a FOUR!!! The ball barely goes away from stumps as DC tries to sneak in a quick single, Arshad throws but misses the stumps as a run-out opportunity goes begging for LSG. Fraser tries to go big again but misses the ball. SIX!!!!! Fraser does it again as he pulls it over deep-mid wicket fence for a maximum, similar to his last maximum. This time over the off-side as Fraser opens his bat and hits it over backward-point for a FOUR!!!
                    Last match’s hero, Yash Thakur to Warner. A dot to start the over. A quick double next as Warner slashes it through point.Arshad continues his spell. A quick single by Shaw to open the over.

                    Abishek Porel comes in as Impact Player and Khaleel Ahmed goes out. Mukesh Kumar has the ball. FOUR! Mid-off inside, the ball is pitched up and Badoni lifts this over the circle for a boundary. That’s the 50-run partnership, off just 33 balls. FOUR! Innovation at its best from Badoni. He gets low after shuffling across his stumps and sweeps this to the square-leg fence. Mukesh comes around the wicket. Badoni clips this yorker to long-on and comes back for the second. Badoni shuffles across again and tries the ramp but doesn’t get a good connection. Badoni gloves an attempted scoop to the keeper, and Pant throws it unnecessarily to allow them to come back for two. Low full toss and put away for a single. That’s a 31-ball fifty for Badoni.

                    The polls are also an acid test for Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and his deputy and NCP chief Ajit Pawar as they have cast their lots with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by splitting their respective parties.
                    
                    But the challenge is tougher for Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar as they are out of power and have lost control of their parties -- Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), respectively -- along with the original name and electoral symbol.</p>

                    <b>Agriculture: </b>India is expected to produce 105 million metric tons of wheat this year, a flour millers' body said on Monday, 6.25% lower than a government estimate.
                    India, the world's biggest wheat consumer and grower after China, banned exports in 2022 and is relying on bumper harvests to bolster stocks and tame local prices that surged after dry weather shrivelled the crop in 2022 and 2023."After assessing the crop across the country, we believe that wheat production will be 105 million metric tons this year," said Navneet Chitlangia, senior vice president of the Roller Flour Millers Federation of India.According to a government estimate, India is likely to produce 112 million metric tons of wheat in 2024.In 2023, India produced a record 112.74 million metric tons of wheat, according to the farm ministry, but trade and industry officials said last year's wheat production was at least 10% less than the government's estimate.      Lower wheat output forced the government to sell a record 10 million metric tons of wheat from its reserves to bulk buyers such as flour millers and biscuit makers, leading to a drawdown in reserves essential for the world's biggest food welfare programme.
